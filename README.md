# Tellonym-account-creator
The fastest tellonym.me account creator on Github

# Requirements
1. capmonster.cloud, anti-captcha.com or 2captcha.com API key
2. Cheap 3$ proxies from https://www.webshare.io/?referral_code=vfoze0j60n05 (use my referral for a discount)
4. Download the following python packages via "pip install -r requirements.txt"
# How to use
* Input your proxies in the ./Data/proxies.txt directory (the same ones you just bought from webshare.io)
* Configure config.json. The captchaApi field may be confusing but do as I say, putting the number 1 means you are going to solve using capmonster.cloud, number 2 means you are going to solve via anti-captcha.com and number 3 means you are going to solve using 2captcha.com. Just put the apikey corresponding to that.
* Install all python packages via "pip install -r requirements.txt"
* To run the creator.py file, type this in command prompt "python creator.py"
